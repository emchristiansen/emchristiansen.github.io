<h2>PhD candidate at UCSD in computer vision</h2>
<p>
I am a PhD candidate in the department of <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/">computer science and engineering</a> at the University of California, San Diego, advised by <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~sjb/">Serge Belongie</a>.
My research interests include computer vision and machine learning.
I also have a fatal attraction to sparse methods and functional programming languages.

<p>	
While an undergrad at <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>, I worked in the summers with <a href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/~gary/">Gary Cottrell</a> on a variety of cognitive science topics, thanks to whom I have an interest in machine vision and biologically inspired models.
In 2008 I graduated with honors with a BA in math and a minor in computer science.
</p>

<p>
I began at UCSD in 2008, where my first focus was machine learning, working with <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~elkan/">Charles Elkan</a>.
During this time, I attended the <a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/mlss09/">Machine Learning Summer School</a> at Cambridge University, where I presented a paper on theoretical machine learning. 
</p>

<p>
In 2009, I switched my focus to computer vision with <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~sjb/">Serge Belongie</a>, with whom I have since remained.

To date, I have been in the PhD program for @personal.controllers.PersonalSite.phdMonth months, and 16 of those have been spent in internships.
I find industry to be a refreshing change of pace.

<h3>2012 - 2013: Willow Garage</h3>
<p>
In June 2012 I started as a 3-month research intern at <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/">Willow Garage</a>, working in robot perception.
I liked it so much that I twice extended the internship, finally ending in March 2013.
While there, I:
<ul>
<li>
Developed a similarity-invariant version of the <a href="#LUCID">LUCID</a> descriptor.
This new descriptor, <a href="#eLUCID">eLUCID</a>, is especially fast on mobile devices. 
</li>
<li>
Developed a <a href="#MTC">match-time covariant local descriptor</a> which is extremely robust to changes in rotation and scale.
</li>
<li>
Created <a href="#BillyPilgrim">Billy Pilgrim</a>, an open-source framework for local descriptor evaluation. 
</li>
<li>
Created an <a href="#OpenCVJava">automatic Java interface generator</a> for OpenCV.
</li>
</ul>
See <a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/blog/2013/04/03/optimizing-computer-vision-and-new-tools-perception-research">this blog post</a> for more information on the above.
</p>

<p>
While at Willow, I also organized two programs for the wider benefit of the company.
First, I taught a twice-weekly CrossFit class, using equipment Willow purchased for the purpose.
Second, when Willow had to lay off its kitchen staff, I organized company-wide catering, paid for by the employees.
This inspired me to create <a href="#FoodForThought">Food for Thought</a> at UCSD.
</p>

<h3>Summers of 2011 and 2010: Google</h3>
<p>
I had two 3-month internships at Google in the summers of 2011 and 2010.
In 2011, I was at the LA and NYC offices, working on Google Goggles research and backend infrastructure.
In 2010, I was at the Mountain View office, helping the webcrawler to detect and appropriately handle duplicate websites.
</p>

<h1 id="Research">Research</h1>
<p>
My primary area of research is in local descriptor methods, e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform">SIFT</a>, which are used in computer vision to compare local regions of images.
They are building blocks for many computer vision applications, including structure-from-motion and object detection and recognition.
</p>

<p>
From an internship I did at Google, I have an abiding interest in fast and/or approximate methods for nearest neighbor (NN) search.
NN search is a fundamental technology underlying many machine learning techniques.
In particular, I'm interested in the non-vector-space case, where methods such as projection-based locality sensitive hashing cannot be applied. 
</p>

<p>
I am also strongly interested in sparse methods for image representation, including dictionary learning and compressive sensing.
Such methods can be used to capture the relevant signal in images, without requiring human-designed features.
In particular, I am interested in how such methods may be sped up, as it appears computational efficiency is the main blocker to wider adoption.

<h1 id="Projects">Projects</h1>
Throughout my PhD, I've kept sane by working on a number of side-projects.
The coding projects often involve my interest in functional programming, and the non-coding projects often concern human empowerment.
Here are a few from 2013:

<h3>2013</h3>
<ul>
<li>
CODE:
Eric Christiansen,
"PersistentMap".
A type-safe, boilerplate-free, key-value store for Scala.
[<a href="https://github.com/emchristiansen/PersistentMap">code</a>]
</li>
<li id="FoodForThought">
NOT CODE:
Eric Christiansen,
"Food for Thought".
Food for Thought (FFT) is a program I developed with the support of my advisor, in which we provide Google-style free food to all members of our lab at UCSD.
I believe it significantly increases lab morale and productivity, and I think academia badly needs to adapt to the times and widely adopt programs such as this.
[<a href="http://23.21.130.222/">FFT website</a>]
</li>
<li id="OpenCVJava">
CODE:
Eric Christiansen, Andrey Pavlenko, and Andrey Kamaev,
"OpenCV Java".
I added an automatically-generated Java interface to OpenCV, with the help of employees at <a href="http://itseez.com/">Itseez</a>.
I did it so I could use Scala for research ;).

</li>
<li id="BillyPilgrim">
CODE:
Eric Christiansen,
"Billy Pilgrim".
Billy Pilgrim is an evaluation framework for local descriptors, intended to replace <a href="http://www.vlfeat.org/benchmarks/">VLBenchmarks</a>.
It is broken into a backend (Billy) and a frontend (Pilgrim), and is in Scala.
